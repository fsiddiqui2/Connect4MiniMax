# Connect4MiniMax
## About
This project started when coding a connect 4 game for a school project. To take the original project further, I learned about the minimax algorithm and created a bot to play against. In need of a better UI, I also learned the basics of Flask and ReactJS and integrated these into the project. In the future, I plan on adding more customization to the game (such as playing against different bots or changing the grid size), as well as implementing deep reinforcement learning.

## Instructions for Use
1. Install flask and react
2. Clone this repo to a local repository 
3. With the directory open, run `python flask-server/server.py` and `cd my-reactswc-app; npm run dev` in different terminal windows
